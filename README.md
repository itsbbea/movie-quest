# Movie Quest Recommendation Tool

## Description
Tired of not knowing and deciding what to watch? We've got you covered. Movie Quest is a random movie generator, which takes a series of user inputs to generate a random movie. Users have the option of choosing their selected genre, release date and language of their preferred movie. 
Once the user has chosen their desired catergories, a random movie gets picked and displayed on the screen, with a synopsis and visual trailer of the movie. The user also has the option to start their search again or click to the next movie which will be generated.

Use at least two server-side APIs.

Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
